# Java Project to study about Design Patterns

###### Project created during the classes of "Deep dive into Java with architecture and design patterns" formation from Alura

Catalog:

- Strategy : is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

- Chain of Responsibility : is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

- Template Method : is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

- State : is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.

- Command : is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.
